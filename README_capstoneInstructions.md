# TV Show Finder

> It can be hard to track TV shows that you want to watch, especially when you want to share those preferences with a partner or friends. This application allows you to find TV shows by name and cast members, make lists of shows you want to watch, and compare those lists with other people to find shows that you can watch together. It uses the [TVMaze API](https://www.tvmaze.com/api) for data about TV shows.

There are no user stories for deployment: it is expected that you will deploy the application to production after you finish a user story.

There are no user stories for logging: it is expected that you will add logging to the application with enough detail to help you diagnose issues in production.

## Getting started

To get started on this project, fork and clone this repository. Keep in mind that you _will not be making a pull request to this repository._

### Installing and running your application

To install, run the following commands from your command line. Make sure you are in the root directory before running the commands.

```
npm run backend-install
npm run frontend-install
```

To start the project, you have a few different options. View the `package.json` in the root directory to see the scripts available to you.

For development purposes, you will likely want to open up a terminal tab, navigate to the `backend/` directory, and run `npm run dev`. In a different terminal tab you will want to navigate to the `frontend/` directory and run `npm start`.

Alternatively, you can run `npm start` in the `root/` directory which will run the `npm start` commands of both the `backend/` and `frontend/` directory. `npm run start:dev` will do the same, but will run the server in development mode.

### Database setup

Set up a new PostgreSQL database instance by following the instructions in the "PostgreSQL: Creating & Installing Databases" lesson.

Run `cp ./back-end/.env.sample ./back-end/.env` and update the `./back-end/.env` file with the connection URLs to your PostgreSQL database instance.

Navigate to the `backend` folder, where the `knexfile.js` file is located, and run the `npx knex` commands from there.

### Running the tests

To run the tests for the backend, you can use the `npm test` command from the root directory of this project.

## Existing files

As you work through the user stories listed later in this document, you will be writing code that allows your frontend and backend applications to talk to each other. You will also write code to allow your controllers and services to connect to, and query, your PostgreSQL database via [Knex](http://knexjs.org/).

The table below describes the folders in this starter repository:

| Folder/file path | Description                                                      |
| ---------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `./backend`      | The backend project, which runs on `localhost:5001` by default.  |
| `./frontend`     | The frontend project, which runs on `localhost:3000` by default. |

This starter code closely follows the best practices and patterns established in the Robust Server Structure module.

**Note**: Please do not submit a pull request to this repository with your solution.

### The root directory

The root directory (where this file is located) contains the instructions for your project, a `.gitignore` file, and a `package.json` file.

The `package.json` file includes a number of scripts which may be useful for building your project. Before beginning your project, make sure to look through the file.

### Backend directory

The backend directory contains a working server although there are no pre-written routes. The following files and folders are present within it:

#### Configuration files

The following files will aid in configuring your backend project:

- The `package.json` file includes a number of scripts which may be useful for building your project.

- The `.env.sample` file includes the environment variables you will need to complete your project. This file should be copied to a `.env` file and then the values should be replaced.

- The `knexfile.js` file includes configuration details for your [Knex](http://knexjs.org/) installation. Keep in mind that your connection will only work if you define a `DATABASE_URL` within your `.env` file.

#### `src/` directory

The `src/` directory includes two files and two directories.

The `app.js` and `server.js` file will aid in running your application. You will likely not need to make any edits to the `server.js` file, but you will need to make edits to the `app.js` file to add your routes and potentially other middleware.

##### `db/` directory

The `db/` directory contains a `connection.js` file. When you create migrations and seeds, they should appear within this directory under new directories with the same name.

##### `errors/` directory

The two files within this directory will handle errors for your server. They are both used within the `app.js` file.

In order to trigger the function within the `errorHandler` file, you will need to call the `next()` function within a route. An object should be passed into your `next()` function and should have the following shape, although the values should be replaced with appropriate error messages.

```javascript
next({ status: 500, message: "Your error message" });
```

#### `test/` directory

The only automated tests for this project are within this directory.

### Frontend directory

The `frontend/` directory contains a standard React application. Keep in mind that [React Router](https://reactrouter.com/en/6.23.1) is already installed and that the `public/index.html` file includes [Bootstrap 5](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.3/getting-started/introduction/) and [Bootstrap Icons](https://icons.getbootstrap.com/).

## Project requirements

The following requirements are _not optional_ for this project. Some tests depend on these structures being in place.

### Database schema

The following two tables are required. You will also need to figure out some way to keep track of the ingredient quantity overall as well as each recipe's ingredients, which may require one or more additional tables.

#### `accounts` table

Each account represents an individual using the web application.

> **Note:** This project _does not_ require you to implement authentication as part of its requirements. While you may add authentication at a later point, it is not essential to completing the project.

While you made include additional fields to this table, you must have the following fields.

| column name | data type | description                                    |
| ----------- | --------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| `id`        | `integer` | A unique ID for each account.                  |
| `name`      | `text`    | A title for the account.                       |
| `username`  | `text`    | A unique username that represents the account. |

#### `lists` table

Each list represents a collection of shows from the [TVMaze API](https://www.tvmaze.com/api). Each list is associated with a user.

While you made include additional fields to this table, you must have the following fields.

| column name  | data type | description                                               |
| ------------ | --------- | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| `id`         | `integer` | A unique ID for each list.                                |
| `title`      | `text`    | The title of the list.                                    |
| `account_id` | `integer` | A foreign key the represents which account owns the list. |

#### Additional tables and fields

You will need some way to store _at least_ the IDs of shows from the [TVMaze API](https://www.tvmaze.com/api). It is up to you to determine how you wish to store and access this data.

#### Seed data

Your seed data should meet the following requirements:

1. Accounts: Include at least 2 accounts.

2. Lists: Each account should have at least 1 list. Each list should have at least 3 shows.

##### Compatibility Note

The tests utilize an in-memory SQLite database, while the development environment uses a PostgreSQL database. Ensure your seed file can handle both PostgreSQL (development) and SQLite (test) databases. The code should detect the database type and apply the appropriate commands for truncating tables and resetting primary keys.

##### Example Seed File

Below is an example seed file that meets the above requirements and handles both PostgreSQL and SQLite databases:

```js
/**
 * @param { import("knex").Knex } knex
 * @returns { Promise<void> }
 */
exports.seed = async function (knex) {
  const isPostgres = knex.client.config.client === "pg";

  if (isPostgres) {
    // PostgreSQL specific: TRUNCATE TABLE with RESTART IDENTITY
    await knex.raw("TRUNCATE TABLE accounts RESTART IDENTITY CASCADE");
  } else {
    // SQLite specific: DELETE all rows and reset the primary key sequence
    await knex("accounts").del();
    await knex.raw("DELETE FROM sqlite_sequence WHERE name = ?", ["accounts"]);
  }

  // ...
};
```

### API routes

Your API layer should be written in Express and connect to your SQL database using Knex. It should include these routes.

| HTTP method | path                   | description                                                      |
| ----------- | ---------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `GET`       | `/accounts`            | Returns all accounts within the database.                        |
| `GET`       | `/accounts/:accountId` | Returns a single account with the matching ID.                   |
| `POST`      | `/accounts`            | Should create a new account and return that account with its ID. |
| `PUT`       | `/accounts/:accountId` | Updates an account based on the                                  |
| `DELETE`    | `/accounts/:accountId` | Should delete the specified account.                             |
| `GET`       | `/lists`               | Returns all lists within the database.                           |
| `GET`       | `/lists/:listId`       | Returns a single list with the matching ID.                      |
| `POST`      | `/lists`               | Should create a new list and return that list with its ID.       |
| `PUT`       | `/lists/:listId`       | Updates an list based on the                                     |
| `DELETE`    | `/lists/:listId`       | Should delete the specified list.                                |

Keep in mind that you may need additional routes to manage the process of adding and removing shows from lists.

#### Request and response payloads

Your requests and responses should include a `data` key before any data is sent to or from the server. For example, a response from the server to the `GET /recipes` route could look like the following:

```js
{
  data: [
    {
      id: 1,
      name: "Stephanie Lee",
      username: "stephanie.lee",
    },
    // ...
  ];
}
```

If an error occurs, the `data` key _should not_ be present. See the `backend/src/errors/errorHandler.js` to see how errors should be returned.

### Frontend views

Your application should be written in React and should make requests to your API. It should have these screens.

| path                        | screen name    | description                                                                                            |
| --------------------------- | -------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `/`                         | Home           | The home screen should show all lists created by all accounts.                                         |
| `/accounts`                 | Accounts Index | This page should show all of the accounts.                                                             |
| `/accounts/:accountId/new`  | New Account    | This page should allow for the creation of a new account.                                              |
| `/accounts/:accountId/edit` | Edit Account   | This page should allow for an account to be edited.                                                    |
| `/lists/:listId`            | Show List      | This page should show details about a single list, including all shows.                                |
| `/lists/:listId/new`        | New List       | This page should allow for the creation of a new list.                                                 |
| `/lists/:listId/edit`       | Edit List      | This page should allow for a list to be edited.                                                        |
| `/lists/compare`            | Compare Lists  | This page should allow for multiple lists to be selected and display common shows between those lists. |
| `/shows?q=<search>`         | Search Shows   | This page should display all shows returned from the API based on a search term.                       |
| `/shows/:showId`            | Show Show      | This page should display details about a single show.                                                  |

## Rubric

When your final capstone project is graded, your grader will use the above acceptance criteria and this rubric to assess your work.

1. Are all the tests passing?
2. Are all business rules enforced in UI, API, and (if possible) the database?
3. Do all API calls make use of an AbortController?
